## quiz 8

part 1: 
I was inspired by Andy Warhol's work: 100 Cans, Marilyn Diptyque and 100 Dollar Bills. and the week 8 tutorial. It can divide the canvas into small grids. It is very similar to the style of Andy Warhol's works. They are all neatly arranged divided blocks. The content of each divided block is very similar, but there are some differences. . The content in the grid can draw some patterns through the learned code.

part 2: 
I think drawsegment is the most important code in this project, because it can divide the picture or canvas into uniform squares, and it can get the effect I expected very well. First set the value and content of the image and canvas through function preload() {} and function setup() {}. At the same time, you can set different viewing effects for each square through pressmouse or presskey.
